# Remember and Remind!
A Bootstrap reminder app, allows for the leaving of reminders... The information is locally stored with JSON, and each item of the list can be individually removed as well as there being a fixed-position button to remove all of them. They're presented in an unordered list that is hidden by default but can be set to show, both of which have down and up chevrons, respectfully. There is also a submit button to click but the enter key also functions as a submit for ease of navigation. When the values of the localStorage key are empty, the key is then moved.

## Personal Benefits
Learning how to manage localStorage as well as interactions within JQuery/JSON, as well as the thought processes behind how different functions and DOM manipulation interacts with the main document. Fixing problems with: array iteration to grab a specific numerical id for deletion, redeclaring values within keys, displaying said key and values within the DOM. Learning to think critically about how to properly interpret errors and how to better my code to move around them.
